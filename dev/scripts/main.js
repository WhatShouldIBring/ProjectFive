// THE PSEUDO CODE YO

// User selects alcohol type
// User selects budget parameter
// User selects occasion parameter
// User confirms above selections

	// Make Ajax call to LCBO API with users alcohol type
	// Take the results array, filter based on budget parameter, return new array
	// With new array, sort by alcohol content using underscore JS
	 //if occasion stress=true, take top half of array(meaning the highest alcohol content)
	 //Top half of array is shuffled
	 //6 results are displayed (hidden radio buttons, results are wrapped in label)
	 //if occasion stress=false, take bottom half of array (meaning the lowest alcohol content)
	 //Bottom half of array is shuffled
	 //6 results are displayed (hidden radio buttons, results are wrapped in label)

// Users selects 1 of 6 possible products
// User confirms selection using button
	//on button click, user is prompted to share their location and product ID is stored
	//if user rejects, then user is prompted to enter location manually
	//THIS IS UNCONFIRMED: Ajax call is made to Geolocation to return the lat long of the user location(maybe lat long is already returned when user inputs location)
	//Using LCBO API "Stores with product" of user choice, return LCBO stores with the product
	//Compare Lat long of returned LCBO stores to User's lat long (using jsunderscores? _.map _.reduce)
// Display 3 closest locations with inventory that matches users selection


//We will create object of occasions and add stress level as a property with either true or false
